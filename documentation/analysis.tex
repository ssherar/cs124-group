For our group project, we are required to implement a program that can create and convert Unified Modelling Language (UML) diagrams to java code. For this we will create a graphical user interface, in which the user will be able to create, delete and modify class diagrams, add relationships between classes, of all the used types: inheritance, aggregation, composition, implements and uses. The use will also be able to change modifers on classes, meaning that they can make the classes abstract, static etc. Within the class the user will be able to add Variables and Methods, and the user will be able to set the return types, variable types, and any arguments that will be passes into the method. These will then be used to export the code to usable .java files. We also aim to implement a image export function where the user will be able to save the diagram they have created as a .png, .jpg, or .gif file allowing them to easily add it to a project for design puropses if required. Alongside this we may introduce a print to printer function where the user can print the class diagram directly to their desired printer. We will also try to create an extensive user manual explaining, in detail, functions of the program and how to use them.
