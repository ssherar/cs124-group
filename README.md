## WORK STARTS ON VERSION 1.1:

If you are interested in working on this, please contact me on Facebook. I finally worked up the courage to look at the code again, got some new ideas and I really think we should push this to a fully usable, native application before abandoning it completely. The program's got promise, it's only a few missing features away from being a great UML tool.

The new feature list is on my ProjectPier, I'll add you if you contact me. I did hope we could start work on this version earlier, but it took me a whole four months to get over the exhaustion from the original project. I'd like to get this done before mid-September, if that's possible.  

I'll be updating this readme as I go along.
