\begin{center}\LARGE{UML2Java Graphical Designer}
\end{center}

\texttt{UML2Java} is a Graphic User Interface program that allows a user to create UML2 class diagrams. The program will then output the class files from the created class diagram including all relevant fields, methods and relationships to other classes. The UML designer was created as a requirement for our first year group project.

\section{Editing Canvas Settings}
\subsection{Resize the Canvas} \index{Canvas Settings!Resize}
If you require a different canvas size , you can do this from the top menu, pressing \texttt{Canvas $\rightarrow$ Resize}
\newpage %can be deleted once images become available

\subsection{Fitting to Diagram} \index{Canvas Settings!Fit to Diagram}
The canvas menu option also allows you to resize the canvas to a state where all of the current contents of the diagram will be able to be seen with little white space around the resulting design, to achieve this press \texttt{Canvas $\rightarrow$ Fit to Diagram}
\begin{center} \includegraphics[trim = 0pt 500pt 0pt 0pt, clip, scale=0.45]{./images/canvas-fitto.png} \end{center}

\section{Exporting}
\subsection{Export to Code} \index{Exporting!Code}
To create the code files of your created diagram, go to the top bar and select \texttt{Export $\rightarrow$ Code} this will generate the .java files of your created diagram, it will take into account any relationships you have created between classes, any variable declarations you have made, and methods you have created. Or you can go to the left menu bar and select \texttt{Export to Java} from the list there. \par

\begin{center}\includegraphics[trim = 0pt 300pt 700pt 0pt, clip, scale=0.4]{./images/addnewclass1.png} \end{center}
To make sure that you have selected to add a new class, once pressed a message will appear in the status bar at the bottom of the window
\begin{center}\includegraphics[trim = 0pt 0pt 500pt 675pt, clip, scale=0.7]{./images/addnewclass2.png} \end{center}
To add the class to the diagram, left-click on the white canvas and your new class will appear
\begin{center}\includegraphics[scale=0.3]{./images/addnewclass3.png} \end{center}
You will recieve confirmation via the status bar at the bottom of the screen, giving the x and y co-ordinates of the generated class box
