Documentation about the "JPanel change"

There was an inherent problem with our approach to painting the canvas - we had to paint EVERYTHING manually
and the manager had to listen to everything at once as well. Text editing, while still possible, would have 
had to be done manually as well. 

The change is that now DocumentElement extends JPanel. This has a number of huge advantages:

- We can now implement text editing simply by adding custom JTextAreas onto relevant JPanels
- The complexity of the manager is significantly reduced. DocumentElements will be able to listen to themselves.
- If support is added later for additional functions, it will be a lot easier this way

So, here is the summary of the changes so far:

- ClassRectangle has its own paintComponent method.
- All drawing has been removed from the Canvas; some scraps of code still remain, because
- Even though Relationships are now technically JPanels as well, I don't expect them to be treated as such.
  The Canvas will probably still have to draw them (this allows for modifying line points and stuff)
- DocumentElement now has fields for zoom and font and the Manager sets them accordingly.
- DocumentPreferences now store the zoom because the Component size is calculated dynamically off it and we'd
  get into trouble if we saved one but not the other.
  
TODOs relating to this change:
- Have JSlider adjust itself when loading a document with custom zoom.

That is all.
